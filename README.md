https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kashishparmar02/social-media-sentiments-analysis-dataset/code
 
This project aims to analyze user-generated content across various social media platforms to uncover sentiment trends and user behavior. The dataset offers a rich source of data, including text-based content, user sentiments, timestamps, hashtags, user engagement metrics (likes and retweets), and geographical information. By exploring this data, we can identify how emotions fluctuate over time, platform, and geography. We will also investigate the correlation between popular content and user engagement metrics.
 
#Problem Statement:

The primary goal is to perform sentiment analysis, investigate temporal and geographical trends in user-generated content, and analyze platform-specific user behavior. The project will focus on identifying popular topics through hashtags, exploring engagement levels, and understanding regional differences in sentiment trends.

Visualize the distribution of sentiments and examine the emotional landscape of social media platforms.

#Temporal Analysis:
Explore temporal patterns in user sentiment over time using the "Timestamp" column.
Identify recurring themes, seasonal variations, or any significant trends in the data.

#User Engagement Insights:
Analyze user engagement by studying the likes and retweets associated with posts.

Understand how social media content and sentiment differ across various regions.

#Cross-Feature Analysis:
Combine features (e.g., sentiment and hashtags, sentiment and platform) to uncover deeper insights about user behavior and content trends.

#Predictive Modeling (Optional):
Explore the possibility of building predictive models to predict user engagement (likes/retweets) based on sentiment, hashtags, and platform.
Evaluate the performance of the model and explore its potential for predicting popular content.
